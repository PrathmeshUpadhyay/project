   <h2>The Elder Wand</h2> 
   <p>A lot of people would argue that one Hallow rises above and beyond the others – the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny. So legendary is this wand that it has acquired many names throughout the centuries, but ultimately, only one exists. This seemingly unbeatable weapon has driven many a wizard to callously murder its previous owner – with a long line of significant people carrying it, from Gellert Grindelwald to Lord Voldemort. Of course, a wizard doesn’t have to be killed in order to acquire it – Albus Dumbledore won the wand fair and square from Grindelwald in their famous 1945 duel, while Harry became its master after disarming Draco Malfoy. Voldemor’s obsession with it ultimately led to his downfall. So, it’s not that great, is it? </p>

   <h2>The Resurrection Stone</h2> 
   <p>No spell can reawaken the dead’, Dumbledore once told Harry – although this legendary stone possesses magic that comes close. As told in ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers’, the Resurrection Stone has the power to bring loved ones back from the grave – but at a cost. In the story, when the second brother used the stone to bring back his lost love, she was ‘sad and cold’ and didn’t ‘truly belong’ in the mortal world anymore, causing the brother to kill himself in despair.aWhen Harry learnt of sucah a stone, this was understandably the Hallow that enchanted him the most. After experiencing so much loss in his life, it was natural Harry would gravitate to the one thing that could bring his loved ones back, albeit not truly as they were before. </p>

   <h2>The Invisibility cloak</h2> 
   <p>So funny to think that we were introduced to a Hallow so early in Harry’s adventures – in fact, the very first book. Funnier still, to think that Harry used one of the most powerful and rare objects in the world to basically sneak around Hogwarts and mess about.Passed down to him from his father, this magnificent Invisibility Cloak had been an heirloom in the Potter family for many years – and it started with Ignotus Peverell, one of the three brothers believed to have inspired Beedle the Bard’s story, ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers’.The Invisibility Cloak makes a great case for being the best Hallow – as the brother who chose it was able to evade death for many years, unseen, while the other two brothers had much unhappier endings. </p>
